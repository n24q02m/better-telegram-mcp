"""XPIA (indirect prompt-injection) defence for external Telegram content.

Tool results that surface messages, chat metadata, member/contact profiles, or
downloaded-media paths carry text authored by arbitrary Telegram users. This
module marks that content as untrusted on BOTH MCP response channels so a
downstream LLM treats it as data, never as instructions:

- ``wrap_external_content`` — XML boundary tags for the text block.
- ``mark_external_payload`` — envelope markers for structuredContent.
- ``build_external_tool_result`` — both of the above, per tool call.

SSRF / path-traversal validation lives in ``backends/security.py``; this module
is purely about the prompt-injection boundary.

    Error payloads (``{"error": ...}``) are handled asymmetrically. A
    server-synthesized error ("Not configured", "'send' requires chat_id") is
    not external content, so labelling its whole text block
    ``<untrusted_{tool}_content>`` would mislead. The text block therefore stays
    UNWRAPPED. But the structuredContent envelope marker is applied
    UNCONDITIONALLY: the boundary cannot prove an error string is free of
    embedded external content — ``safe_error`` echoes ``str(exc)`` for
    ValueError/SecurityError, and an exception raised deep in Telethon can quote
    matched message text. Over-marking a trusted error is harmless; under-marking
    one that quotes external text is the vuln.
